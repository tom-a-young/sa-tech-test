# Use React for the Legends App

* Date: 2021-07-15 

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to build a fast, scalable and appealing Legends App which will alow our users to stream video. In future we will also want to make a native app for devices.

## Decision Drivers 

* Speed of development
* Reusability
* Scalability

## Considered Options

* Angular
* React
* Static Website

## Decision Outcome

We have chosen React as our option as it is a very mature platform with notably positive developer experience. Crucially, it could allow us to easily migrate to React Native when building the native app in future.
